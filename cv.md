## About me
 I started my programming journy in march 2023 with SD.CODE. This course was created by TL form Avito. By this course i received a lot of basic knowleges in HTML, CSS, JS and continue learning React.js.
 I still feel that i need more basic skills in JS, and this is reason why i came to RS School 
 I also would like to get as much as it possible from this course, and i see myself in the end of Stage3 
 I have good soft-skills, because for the last four years i am working in HR 
 I hope that my soft-skills and hard-skills that i will get on this course will help me to find job like Front-End developer
 My main goal is to be a part of EPAM Czech Republic!  

## Skills
 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * JS Vanilla, ES6
 * React.js
 * Vite
 * Firebase
 * BEM
 * Figma
 * VS Code
 * Git
 * GitHub
 
## Code
`
const arrOfNums = [5, 10, 20, 115, 11, 1]

const findBiggest = (arr) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if(arr[i] > result) {
      result = arr[i]
    }
  }
  return result
}
